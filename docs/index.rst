neXtSIM_DG : the next generation sea-ice model with a Discontinuous Galerkin method

Introduction
------------

**The neXt generation Sea Ice Model (neXtSIM) is a Lagrangian dynamical-thermodynamical sea-ice model that faithfully represents large-scale sea ice thickness, concentration and drift patterns** [1]_ [2]_ **, statistical properties of pack ice deformation and drift** [3]_ [2]_ **, diffusion and dispersion** [4]_ [5]_ **; and additionally exhibits a strong capacity for short-term sea ice forecasting at Pan-Arctic scales** [6]_ **. neXtSIM was developed to explore the role of sea-ice mechanics and dynamics in determining the large-scale behaviour of Arctic sea ice. As such, it has served as a testing and development ground for the brittle sea-ice rheologies developed over the past decade** [7]_ [8]_ [9]_ [2]_ **.** The initial development of the model was focused on understanding and representing as well as possible the impact of the new physics developments, which was the main rationale for the Lagrangian advection scheme used. As the new physics developments matured it became evident that these could impact not only the ice, but also the ocean and atmosphere below and above it [10]_.

In order to better understand the role of sea-ice mechanics and dynamics in the coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice system we are developing a new version of neXtSIM, neXtSIM_DG. neXtSIM_DG is the Eulerian version of the neXtSIM model, using the discontinuous Galerkin method (DG) for advection, instead of the Lagrangian scheme used in previous neXtSIM versions. The DG method has proven extremely effective and efficient in retaining high gradients in fluid dynamics [11]_ [12]_ , while the Lagrangian neXtSIM proved challenging to couple with other models and difficult to optimise for highly parallel environments.

The core idea behind neXtSIM_DG remains the same as that behind the original neXtSIM: to explore the role of sea-ice mechanics and dynamics in determining the large-scale behaviour of Arctic sea ice. With the new version we aim to extend the use of the model to fully coupled and global simulations, resulting in a model that can be used from regional short term forecasting applications to global climate simulations. To achieve this, the model infrastructure will be modular and flexible, so that it can easily be coupled to other models and systems and so that new parameterisations and physical routines can easily be added. The dynamical core will use the DG method to ensure the best possible preservation of high gradients in an Eulerian framework, while still maintaining good computational performance.
